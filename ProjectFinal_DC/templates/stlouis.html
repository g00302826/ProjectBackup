	Prior to European settlement, the area was a major regional center of Native American Mississippian culture. The city of St. Louis was founded in 1764 by French fur traders Pierre Lacl√®de and Auguste Chouteau, and named after Louis IX of France. The area was ceded to Spain following France's defeat in the Seven Years' War (the area east of the Mississippi was ceded to Britain). In 1800, Spanish Louisiana was retroceded back to France. In 1803, the United States acquired the territory as part of the Louisiana Purchase.
